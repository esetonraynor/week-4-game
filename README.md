# Thieves Guild Pickpocket Challenge
Do you have the finesse (and the math skills) to join the Thieves Guild? Your challenge is to "steal" just enough gold to avoid being detected without going over the requested amount. Click the bags of gold to see how much each is worth. You may click them as many times as necessary to get to the desired sum. But if you go over, you'll be detected!
